I biggest difference I noticed when comparing the page in this lab to the page I created in week 4 is not having to deal
with dom elements in our javascript code. It makes writing our javascript code much simpler. Another difference I
noticed in this page was the ability to reference variables created in our javascript code in the html of our page.

If I had to choose between coding this page using Vue.js or just vanilla JavaScript I would honestly just do vanilla
JavaScript. I can see how Vue could be a life-saver on a larger scale webpage, but for a webpage of this size I don't
think it is really necessary.
